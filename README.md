# react-component-library
 
I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to practice 
making reusable and customizable components. I also wanted to 
create a custom hook "useToggle" that allowed me to toggle state
of anything I needed (which I really only needed it for the menu
component) and use Context to allow me to share the state in my 
custom hook without having to drill props.

Please take a look at my deployed project here:
